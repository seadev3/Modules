PRINT VULNERABILITY SCANNER
TECHNICAL TASK


GOAL
You need a scanner for vulnerable printers that are accessible from the Internet.
The result of the scanner's work is a list of addresses where there is a printer with a confirmed vulnerability.


ALGORITHM
The scanner combines two public services: https://shodan.io and Printer Exploitation Toolkit https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET
- On shodan.io we do a search, for example, for the word PJL
- parse the results and feed them to the PRET script
- if the PRET script was able to connect to the printer, execute the commands in sequence
 id
 pwd
 ls
 df
and write the command itself and its result to the log
- go to the next search result.

Note: You need an account to access shodan.io. But in theory it is safe even when implemented as a module for a bot.
You can pre-download the necessary data in .csv format and upload them separately to bots through configs.
Exporting search results to .csv/.json from shodan.io is a paid service.

IMPLEMENTATION
There are two implementation options:
*as a standalone scanner.
  + Execution language - any scripting language, but not too exotic (python, PowerShell, javascript).
  + Fast and easy.
* as a module to the bot
  + the implementation is much longer, because need to rewrite PRET in C++
  + but you can work distributed
