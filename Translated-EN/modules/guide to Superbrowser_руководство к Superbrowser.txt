SuperBrowser v.0.70

Description:
---------
The software is designed to simulate work in a browser using someone else's fingerprints.
For this:
- Grabber module collects browser profiles (cookies, locale, time zone, etc.)
- Superbrowser allows you to use these fingerprints to work as this user.


Settings for working with the program:
----------------------------------
To get started you need:
- go through the procedure of activating your machine to work with SuperBrowser!!!
- installed TOR Browser
- folder with SuperBrowser with the following content:
contains 21 files. Important to use are:
- launcher.exe - to launch the browser on new operating systems
- launch_win7.cmd - to launch the browser on older OS
- cache - cache profiles
- profiles - profiles for each config (a new one is created after each launch of the browser)
- confs - configs from the assembled machine (they appear in the folder when you start the browser from the storage admin panel)
- bot admin account
- storage admin account

We connect superbrowser as a "mail agent" to Tor Browser:
1.Open the Tor browser.
- enter about:config
- look for the network.protocol-handler.external.mailto option in the search
- set to true
Otherwise, mailto will not work correctly.
2.Next, you need to write the path to launcher.exe (located in the sbrowser folder) to your Tor browser (in which the storage admin panel is open):
- Go to the Tor menu: Setting(Options)-> General -> Applications -> mailto option
- Write the path to our browser (field to the right of mailto):
          On older operating systems (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows XP with SP3, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003), specify the path to launch_win7.cmd
          On new OS, specify the path to launcher.exe
          (Otherwise, Mozilla Firefox will not work properly. This is due to bugs in Windows and Firefox.)

*This is a one time thing.

This hack is used to launch our software when clicking on special links in the admin area.

Usage:
--------------
1. We take a working bot in the bots admin panel.
2. Copy the machine id (field Prefix + Client)
3. Go to the storage admin panel. We find the car by id.
4. We follow the link of the found car.
In the car data window we see a line like this: Grabber: Chrome Firefox IE Edge Start. Click Start
(this runs a command that goes to the bot so that the module is loaded / started there).
When the collection is completed, numbers like this will appear: Chrome16-6 Firefox IE:16-6 (it may take a long time for the numbers to appear, but the collection is completed. Depends on the load on the storage)
5. Click on the icon of the desired browser.
If the settings of the prescribed path to launcher.exe (SuperBrowser) are correct, then launcher.exe will be launched with the profile of the desired browser.
* In this way, the robbed profile is loaded from storage into superbrowser.

In a running launcher:
- top left browser profile selection window, type: Chrome as Jim(FISHPC).
- in the Values ​​tab in the parameters there is a line conf.userchrome:
- if you set it to false or leave it empty, then after pressing run browser the browser will mimic Mozilla Firefox
- if set to true, then the browser will mimic Chrome (if it gives an error, ignore it)
- do not touch other parameters.
* You can check for cookies in the Cookies tab.
6. Click Run Browser (a profile will be created and the browser will start).
7. Check browser links.

Additionally:
When checking cookies through SuperBrowser, it is possible to insert socks into the corresponding field. The field is on the top right, called "Socks (no proxy)".



Possible errors when starting the browser and their elimination:
-------------------------------------------------- -
1. error 213 - solved by disabling flash cookies:
1. in the launcher.exe window there is a FlahLso tab - right-click - disable all (or remove all checkmarks).
2. error 181 - solved: 1. delete the contents of the cache folder (path sbrowser --> cache).
2. delete the contents of the profiles folder (path sbrowser --> profiles).
3. restart SuperBrowser.
3. Could not AssignProcessToObject - appears when SuperBrowser is launched on older operating systems noted below - you need to set the path to launch_win7.cmd (look at the Tor settings item).
